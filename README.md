# UI RPA Testing App

A lightweight project intended for experimenting with UI automation/RPA concepts and validating selectors, flows, and styles in a simple UI context.

## Overview

This repository contains front-end assets you can use to prototype and test UI automation scenarios. It is designed to be simple to launch locally and easy to iterate on while building or validating RPA scripts.

## Features

- Minimal setup for quick experimentation
- Clean separation of styles
- Suitable for validating selectors and interaction flows

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your editor of choice (e.g., VS Code).
3. Open your HTML entry file in a browser (if present) or create one and link the stylesheet.

Tip: Using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code can streamline reloading during development.

## Project Structure

- `styles.css` — Global styles for the UI used in testing
- `README.md` — Project documentation

Additional files (such as HTML or JavaScript) can be added as needed for your specific automation test cases.

## Development Notes

- Keep element attributes (like `id`, `data-*`, and `aria-*`) stable to make selectors in RPA tools more robust.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible patterns to reduce flaky selectors.
- When testing complex flows, start with small, deterministic steps and build up.
